# ReactiveType

a typing test (as if we needed another one) - built in React

### Features:
- ~~nothing yet...~~ oh boy do we have features now
- tracks each word and highlights
- shows error/color on error

### Future Features
- clean up Home.js (separate into diff. components?)
- highlights each letter and compares 2 strings (convert stateless --> stateful?)
- import and text/file into the program
- take time and calculate wpm (maybe even count errors)
- hot swap themes
- congrats message

### Goal
- Hopefully I can get to functionality similar to [KeyHero](https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/)
