# ReactiveType

a typing test (as if we needed another one) - built in React

### Features/done:
- ~~nothing yet...~~ oh boy do we have features now
- tracks each word and highlights
- :heavy_check_mark: clean up Home.js (separate into diff. components?)
- shows error/color on invalid user input
- :heavy_check_mark: highlights each letter and compare 2 strings
- take time and calculate wpm (maybe even count errors)
  - start timer with first word
    - [https://codesandbox.io/s/2p7no5ol8r](https://codesandbox.io/s/2p7no5ol8r)
  - check if is on last word & stop timer!

### Future Features
- import and text/file into the program
- hot swap themes
- congrats message

### Goal
- Hopefully I can get to functionality similar to [KeyHero](https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/)
